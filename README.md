# Assignment

As part of our recruitment process, we would like you to create a prototype web application to demonstrate your knowledge of the required technical standards.

The application will ideally have a frontend built with React, a backend API using Node.js, and a PostgreSQL database, but other databases can also be considered. You might make use of frameworks within those technologies if you prefer, e.g. Fastify for node.js, but not limited.

As this is a prototype, we donâ€™t expect you to spend any more than 2-3 hours of your time, but there is no limit or minimum time requirement.

The application could demonstrate:

    Capturing some data from the end-user, e.g. star rating and a comment
    Displaying back average rating and list of all ratings and comments
    Ordering results by low-to-high or high-to-low ratings
    Optionally, any visualisation, e.g. chart with average ratings on each day

You can populate example data in the database.

We would like to receive the code and database examples and talk through the project in the second interview.

Thank you.

# How to run the solution

- Navigate to project
- Run PostgreSQL using `docker compose up -d`
- Go to individual `frontend`, `backend` projects & run `npm install && npm run dev`
- Access the application at `http://localhost:5173/`
